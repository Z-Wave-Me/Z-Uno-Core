# Z-Uno-Core
Core files for Z-Uno support in Arduino IDE 1.6.5

Arduino Board Manager is used to install these files. Installation guide: https://z-uno.z-wave.me/install

Z-Uno is the first and only easy to use developer board that allows you to create your own Z-Wave device without deep knowledge of Z-Wave protocol or programming. Z-Uno is a mix of Z-Wave home automation radio protocol power and Arduino simplicity. Being inspired by Arduino project Z-Uno inherits all concepts of easy-to-use hardware and software solutions, keeping maximum flexibility.

Z-Uno is a fully DIY product. It is made for those who are limited by existing choice of Z-Wave products and wants to extend their smart homes with more sensors and actuators: connect LEDs, buttons, switches, motors or any low voltage sensor including most of Arduino compatible sensors.

Z-Uno programming is done by writing sketch in simplified C language (language reference: https://z-uno.z-wave.me/Reference) and loaded into Z-Uno using Arduino IDE. Many examples and comprehensive tutorials will help you to make your own project. See https://z-uno.z-wave.me/examples

Being Z-Wave Plus certified device, Z-Uno is the perfect companion for you RaZberry gateway (https://razberry.z-wave.me). Z-Uno is compatible with other controllers too.

# Z-Uno project roadmap
